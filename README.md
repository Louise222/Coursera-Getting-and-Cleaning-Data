This is a four-week course. Dec 7th, 2015 - Jan 3rd, 2016.

This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.

First, unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and rename the folder with "data". Make sure the folder "data" and the run_analysis.R script are both in the current working directory. Or you can just download this repository and set your current working directory in this folder.

Second, use source("run_analysis.R") command in RStudio.

Third, you will find an output file generated in the current working directory:
